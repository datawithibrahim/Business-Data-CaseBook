### Business Casebook

#### What This Repository Is

This is a master repository where I solve real-world business problems on a regular basis using data.

Each case starts with a business question and uses SQL and Python to analyze datasets, identify patterns, and reach practical conclusions. The emphasis is on structured thinking and decision-making, not on building showcase projects or experimenting with tools.

#### What I Do in This Repository

For each business case:
Define the business problem clearly  
Understand the context and constraints  
Translate the problem into data questions  
Use SQL and Python to analyze the data  
Document insights that matter for business decisions  

Each commit typically represents one focused problem or analytical step.

#### Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to:
-- Build consistency through daily or regular problem-solving  
-- Practice thinking like a business analyst, not just a coder  
-- Maintain a single, evolving record of analytical work  
-- Focus on reasoning, assumptions, and conclusions rather than visuals or polish  

This repository reflects how I approach business analysis in practice.

#### Tools Used

-- SQL for querying and structuring data  
-- Python for analysis and exploration  

The choice of tools is secondary to the clarity of the business reasoning.

#### Discussions

GitHub Discussions are used to capture:
Assumptions and trade offs  
Reflections on alternative approaches  
Discussions are not used for basic syntax or beginner questions.

#### Notes

This repository is actively maintained and evolves over time.  
Earlier cases may be revised as my understanding improves.
