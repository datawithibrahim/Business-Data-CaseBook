### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing India’s export performance using official commodity-wise export data published by the Government of India. The dataset represents actual trade figures and is not simulated or manually created. It reflects real export values reported through the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) under the Ministry of Commerce.

The objective of this project is to study how different commodity groups contribute to India’s total exports, identify growth and decline patterns, and extract meaningful business insights that can support trade related decision making. The analysis is designed from a business and analytical perspective rather than an academic or tutorial based approach.

This project closely mirrors the type of analysis performed by trade analysts, business analysts, and policy teams working with export and economic data.

### Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes the analysis of commodity-wise export data for the financial years 2023–24 and 2024–25. The dataset contains export values, percentage share of each commodity in total exports, and year on year growth figures.

The analysis focuses on understanding:
- The overall export structure of India  
- Contribution of different commodity groups  
- Growth trends across sectors  
- Export concentration and dependency  
- Business implications of export performance  

The project does not involve forecasting or predictive modeling. Instead, it focuses on understanding current trade behavior using descriptive and comparative analysis.

### What Will Be Done in This Project

In this project, official government trade data will be used to study India’s export performance at a commodity level. The dataset will be cleaned and structured to make it suitable for analysis using SQL and spreadsheet-based tools.

The analysis will involve organizing export data in a structured format and examining it from a business and trade perspective. The objective is to understand how export values are distributed across different commodity groups and how export performance changes across financial years.

The work will include:
- Examining export values across different commodity categories  
- Comparing year on year export performance  
- Classifying commodities based on growth behavior  
- Studying how exports are distributed across sectors  
- Interpreting the data from a business and economic point of view  

The purpose of this project is not only to perform calculations but to develop a clear understanding of how India’s export structure functions and how trade data can be analyzed for business and policy related evaluation.

### Key Business Questions That Will Be Addressed

#### Which commodities contribute the most to India’s exports?

This part of the analysis will focus on identifying the commodity groups that contribute the highest share to India’s total export value. The objective is to understand which sectors play a major role in driving export revenue and how export dependence is distributed across commodities.

This will help in understanding the structure of India’s export basket and the extent to which exports rely on specific sectors.

#### Which commodities are growing the fastest?

The project will analyze year on year export values to identify commodities that show higher growth compared to others. This will help in understanding which sectors are expanding and gaining importance in international trade.

The purpose of this analysis is to identify emerging export segments and observe shifts in trade patterns over time.

#### Which sectors are underperforming?

This part of the study will focus on identifying commodity groups that show relatively low or stagnant growth. The analysis will help highlight sectors that may be facing challenges such as limited demand, supply constraints, pricing issues, or operational inefficiencies.

Understanding underperforming sectors is important for evaluating gaps in export performance and identifying areas that may require attention.

#### How concentrated are India’s exports?

The analysis will assess how much of India’s total export value depends on a limited number of commodities. This will help in understanding the level of export concentration and the degree of diversification across sectors.

Evaluating concentration is important for assessing trade stability and understanding potential risks associated with over-dependence on specific commodities.

#### What is the overall export performance?

The project will evaluate overall export performance by comparing total export values across financial years. This will provide a high level view of export trends and help in understanding whether export activity is increasing, stable, or slowing over time.

### Conclusion

This project is designed to perform a structured and detailed analysis of India’s export performance using official government data. The focus is on understanding export composition, growth behavior, and sector wise contribution through systematic analysis rather than drawing conclusions in advance.

The case study is intended to demonstrate how real world trade data can be analyzed in a professional setting and how such analysis can support business understanding, policy evaluation, and data driven decision-making.
