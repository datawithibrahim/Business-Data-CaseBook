### Inventory Level Analysis

![Inventory Level Analysis](https://github.com/datawithibrahim/Business-Data-CaseBook/blob/935ac91707308309c633f01e39657eb18608707c/Supply_Chain/visualizations/inventory_distribution.png)

This chart helps understand how well inventory is being managed across the supply chain.

From the pattern, we can see whether stock levels are mostly high, low, or balanced.  
If inventory remains too high for long periods, it means money is getting blocked in storage and products are not moving fast enough.  
If inventory is frequently low, it increases the risk of order delays and lost customers.

This insight helps businesses decide:
- How much stock should be kept  
- When to restock  
- How to reduce storage and holding costs  

A balanced inventory level directly improves cash flow and delivery efficiency.

### Logistics Delay Reasons

As we can see this chart highlights the major reasons behind delivery delays.

It clearly shows which issues occur most often such as traffic, operational delays, or external factors.  
When one reason appears more frequently than others, it becomes a clear problem area that needs attention.

This analysis helps businesses:
- Identify the biggest cause of late deliveries  
- Improve planning and logistics coordination  
- Reduce customer complaints  

Fixing even one major delay reason can significantly improve delivery performance.


### Transaction Amount

This chart helps understand customer spending behavior.

It shows whether most customers make small purchases or high-value transactions.  
If most transactions are low value, the business may need better pricing strategies or bundle offers.  
If high-value purchases are common, the focus can shift to customer retention.

This insight helps in:
- Pricing decisions  
- Offer and discount planning  
- Identifying valuable customers  

Understanding spending patterns is key to increasing revenue.


### Demand vs Asset Utilization

![Demand](https://github.com/datawithibrahim/Business-Data-CaseBook/blob/935ac91707308309c633f01e39657eb18608707c/Supply_Chain/visualizations/demand_vs_utilization.png)

This chart connects customer demand with how much company resources are being used.

If demand is high but asset usage is low, it means resources are not being used properly.  
If asset usage is high but demand is low, it indicates wastage and inefficiency.

This helps businesses:
- Optimize vehicle and warehouse usage  
- Reduce unnecessary operational costs  
- Improve overall efficiency  

It directly impacts profitability and planning decisions.

### Purchase Frequency Analysis

This chart shows how often customers return to make purchases.

If most users purchase only once, it means customer retention is weak.  
If repeat purchases are common, it indicates trust and satisfaction.

This insight helps businesses:
- Improve customer loyalty strategies  
- Design better offers and reward programs  
- Increase long-term revenue  

Repeat customers are always more valuable than new ones.

### Asset Location Distribution

This chart shows where assets or deliveries are concentrated geographically.

It helps identify:
- High activity zones  
- Low-performing regions  
- Areas needing better logistics support  

Businesses can use this to:
- Improve delivery routes  
- Reduce transportation cost  
- Plan future expansion  

Good location planning directly improves speed and customer satisfaction.


Together, these charts help answer important business questions:

- Why are deliveries getting delayed?  
- Are resources being used efficiently?  
- How do customers behave?  
- Where is money being lost?  
- What should be improved first?  

This analysis helps management take data-driven decisions, reduce waste, and improve overall operational performance.
